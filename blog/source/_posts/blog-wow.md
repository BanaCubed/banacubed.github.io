Welcome to my blog. (Congrats on finding it)
I might as well take this time to talk a bit about why I decided to start a blog in the first place.
<!-- more -->

# Why
I largely decided on starting a blog simply because I wanted to be able to be more transparent about my development process. The entire "ARG" thing was just added on because I realised that this medium would work well for hinting at the interconnected canon starting to form between my games.
For those that are in my discord server, you would probably know by now that I am actually very rarely active there, which has caused some issues with me feeling transparent about the development of my games, since I can kind of tell that the more active members start to view the games as "dead" - even when they are really still quite alive - simply because of my lack of activity.

# About Me
Visit my [homepage](https://banacubed.github.io) for an about me, I would rather not write that again.
(interestingly the source code for this is stored in the same repository, despite being published in a different one)

# Notes
An important thing to note for those that care about the lore here, is that only pages with the lore tag are considered canon (everything else is just an actual blog).

This is actually the second post on this blog because the first one was adapted into the intro to the "ARG" before this one was written (I really do have a strange way of going about things)

I've avoided using contractions because this font hates apostrophes.
If the contraction there didn't look abnormal, I've likely changed the font this site uses.
